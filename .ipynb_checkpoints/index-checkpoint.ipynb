    "\n",
    "SQL rank functions, as the name entails, ranks rows. `ROW_NUMBER()` does just what it sounds like - it displays the number of a given row. \n",
    "`RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` both rank rows based on the `ORDER BY` clause. The difference between two is that `DENSE_RANK()` would consider tying records and not skip rows. Let's say two rows are tied, then both rows would get the same rank, and the next row would be next incremental number, without skipping a rank. "
